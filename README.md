# Simulation of medium complexity mechanistic models


Maltab scripts that I wrote to simulate PROSAIL (http://teledetection.ipgp.jussieu.fr/prosail/; Jacquemoud et al., 2009) and SCOPE (van der Tol et al., 2014). The two models were simulated in sequential mode, meaning the output of PROSAIL was fed to the SCOPE model. I will add more code here about model simulations.
